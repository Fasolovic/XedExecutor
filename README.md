Fivem lua executor (source)


It can be used for: Destroying fivem servers, executing lua file exp, file.lua saving client sides for fivem and lua code execution
that it needs to be update right now it was outdated like two months ago, u would need to update offsets if u would like any help finding offsets i highly recommend: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/fivem/367690-lua-executor.html (for ur help)

The lua executor comes with a panel that u can edit, version and somne other versions if u want to try just type in "TEST" or some other random stuff so u could login in and test the executor like i said is outdated it won't work here.

If u have any problems contact me on discord: emily#6498
